                The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this
                because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from
                where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is
                greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance
                subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to
                drive the missile from a position where it is to a position
                where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it
                now is.
